An elegant home page idea, with a search bar for google search and convinient bookmarks. Right now the bookmarska are fixed, but I will eventually add an option to add your own.
Uses the tilt.js script to bring some movement in the bookmark tiles. "span" elements + css to create the floating orbs underneath.
